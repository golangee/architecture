As a: moderator
I want: to create a new game by entering a name and an optional description
so that: I can start inviting estimators.

scenarios:
  001:
    System user signs in with valid credentials:
      Given: I’m a logged-out system user and I’m on the Sign-In page
      when: I fill in the "Username" and “Password” fields with my authentication credentials and I click the Sign-In button
      then: the system signs me in.

  002:
    User searches for an item by its name:
      Given: that I’m in a role of registered or guest user
      when: I open the “Products” page
      then: the system shows me the list of all products and the system shows the “Search” section in the right top corner of the screen
        when I fill in the “Search” field with the name of existing item in the product list
        and I click the “Apply” button OR press the Enter key on keyboard
        then the system shows products in the Search Results section with product names matching entered product name
        and the system shows the number of search results in the top of the Search Results section
