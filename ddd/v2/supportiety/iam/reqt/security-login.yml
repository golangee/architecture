scenario:
  no anonymous access:
    Given: I have all deep application URLs
    when: I open any URL directly in my browser

  supportiety user signs in with valid credentials:
    Given: I have all deep application URLs and valid credentials
    when: I open any URL directly in my browser
    then: the system tells me that I'm not logged in and after entering my credentials, I can see the protected content.

  supportiety user signs in with invalid credentials:
    Given: I have all deep application URLs and wrong credentials
    when: I open any URL directly in my browser
    then: the system keeps telling me after entering the credentials that they are wrong.

  brute force protection:
    Given: I have a script or bot
    when: I try to brute force credentials
    then: the system responds so slow that such an attack is infeasible.

  password:
    Given: I got a database dump
    when: I try to read or reconstruct the stored passwords
    then: I cannot do so, because the passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
