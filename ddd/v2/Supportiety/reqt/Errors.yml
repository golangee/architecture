i want: to have a clear human readble description of common errors
so that: it is clear to me what to do next.

scenario:
  Other:
    # TODO this is only required to directly use an AC as a type or enum
    doc: ...describes an unclassified error, like an I/O error.
    given: I trigger an internal error like a dead database, full disk or an interrupted connection
    when: working with the system
    then: I get a message of an internal server error.

  NotFound:
    doc: ...describes an error when an entity or object was expected but not found.
    given: I open an URL with a resource id
    when: I delete it and open that URL again
    then: I get a message of an unknown object.

  AlreadyExists:
    doc: ...describes an error where an enity or object should not exist but was found.
    given: I can create resources with customized identifiers
    when: I try to create a resource with an already used identifier
    then: I get a a message of an already used identifier.
