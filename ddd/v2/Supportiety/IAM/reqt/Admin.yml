as a: Admin # TODO flexion is grammatically broken
i want: to list, add, delete and edit all available user
so that: I can ensure that only permitted users have access and also that their correct role, email and names apply.

scenario:
  SetPassword:
    given: I'm an Admin
    when: a SupportietyUser has lost or compromised his password
    then: I need to update his password and give him the new password on a piece of paper.

  WeakPassword:
    doc: ...describes a situation where a password is not safe to use. # TODO again type doc on AC
    given: I'm an Admin
    when: I set a password for a SupportietyUser
    then: the password must have at least 8 chars and must contain at least one uppercase and lowercase and special char.
    # TODO useful enough to be machine reabable? This is not a method, very implicit and in non-trivial cases not unit-test generatable anyway
    rules:
      fail: [ "",a,1234,12345678 ]
      success: [ 123456Ab? ]

# TODO if allowed, everyone will use this instead of real AC or scenarios
rules:
  - empty names are not allowed and must show an according error message
  - passwords must have at least 8 chars and must contain at least one uppercase and lowercase and special char
  - only users with the admin role can see the according option
  - initially a default admin with the password admin is deployed
